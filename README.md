# blood_sugar_tracker_170

This project highlights my Backend Programming capabilities. Users have to be logged in to access the database. If a user is not logged in, a flash message appears when trying to use the services. A user may create a log in and then use the application normally. The app provides the ability to create, view, edit, and delete each entry using various routes with a Ruby and Sinatra backend.

Hint: Use 'admin' for both the username and password if you don't want to create your own!
